# NAME

udotool - emulate input events

# SYNOPSIS

**udotool** [_options_] _cmd_ [_arg_...]

**udotool** [_options_] {**-i** | **\-\-input**} _file_

**udotool** [{**-h** | *\-\-help**} | {**-V** | **\-\-version**}]

# DESCRIPTION

**udotool** lets you simulate input events (keyboard input, mouse movement
and clicks, and more complex input). It does this using Linux **uinput**
driver.

Since **uinput** is a kernel feature, **udotool** should work in X11, in
Wayland, and even in console.

# OPTIONS

The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes ('-'). A summary of options is included below.

**-i** _file_, **\-\-input** _file_
:   Read commands from a file instead of command line. File name **-**
 (single minus sign) can be used for standard input.

**-n**, **\-\-dry-run**
:   Do not execute input emulation commands. Generic commands will be executed anyway.

**\-\-dev** _dev-path_
:   Use specified UINPUT device. Default is **/dev/uinput**.

**\-\-dev-name** _name_
:   Use specified emulated name. Default is **udotool**.

**\-\-dev-id** _vendor-id_[**:**_product-id_[**:**_version_]]
:   Use specified emulated device ID. Default is **0x0000:0x0000:0**.

**-v**, **\-\-verbose**
:   Print more debug messages. Adding multiple **-v** will increase the verbosity.

**-h**, **\-\-help**
:   Show summary of options and exit.

**-V**, **\-\-version**
:   Show version of program and exit.

# COMMANDS

Unless specified otherwise:

- Command and option names are case-sensitive.
- Axis and key names are case-insensitive.
- Time is specified in seconds and parts of seconds.
- Loop and repeat counters are integer.
- For other values see section **VALUE UNITS** below.

## Generic commands

**sleep** _seconds_
:   Wait for specified time. Time is given in seconds, and may be
 fractional. Minimum delay is **0.001** (1 millisecond), maximum
 is **86400** (1 day).

**exec** _command_ [_arg_...]
:   Execute specified command. If _command_ is does not include slashes,
 it will be searched in PATH. Environment for the command will
 include environment variable **$UDOTOOL_SYSNAME**, which contains
 virtual device directory name under **/sys/devices/virtual/input/**.

**script** [{_file_ | **-**}]
:   Execute commands from specified file. If no file name is given or
 if the file name is a single minus sign (**-**), commands will be
 read from the standard input.

**help** [{_command_ | **-axis** | **-key**}...]
:   Print help on commands. If no arguments are specified, **help**
 will print description of all supported commands. Arguments
 **-axis** and **-key** will make **help** print lists of known
 axes and keys, correspondingly.

**loop** [**-time** _seconds_] [_num_]
:   Execute commands between **loop** and corresponding **endloop**
 no more than _num_ times. If option **-time** is specified, the
 loop will be repeated for no more than specified time. Loops may
 be embedded, but maximum stack depth is limited.

**endloop**
:   End corresponding **loop** block.

## Input emulation commands

**key** [**-repeat** _num_] [**-time** _seconds_] [**-delay** _seconds_] _key_...
:   Emulate keys/buttons being pressed down (in order) and then released
 (in reverse order). If option **-repeat** is specified, the whole
 sequence will be repeated no more than _num_ times. If option **-time**
 is specified, the whole option will be repeated for no more than
 specified time. If **-delay** option is specified, its value will be used
 as a delay between each repetition (default is **0.05**, that is,
 50 milliseconds). See also section **KEY NAMES** below.

**keydown** _key_...
:   Emulate key/button being pressed down. If several keys are specified,
 events will be emulated in this sequence. See also section **KEY NAMES** below.

**keyup** _key_...
:   Emulate key/button being released. If several keys are specified,
 events will be emulated in this sequence. See also section **KEY NAMES** below.

**move** [**-r**] _delta-x_ [_delta-y_ [_delta-z_]]
:   Emulate moving pointer by specified delta. This command usually
 uses axes **REL_X**, **REL_Y**, and **REL_Z**, but if option **-r**
 is specified, axes **REL_RX**, **REL_RY**, and **REL_RZ** are used
 instead. See also section **VALUE UNITS** below.

**wheel** [**-h**] _delta_
:   Emulate turning mouse wheel (or horizontal wheel if option **-h**
 is specified) by specified delta. See also section **VALUE UNITS** below.

**position** [**-r**] _delta-x_ [_delta-y_ [_delta-z_]]
:   Emulate moving pointer to specified absolute position. This command
 usually uses axes **ABS_X**, **ABS_Y**, and **ABS_Z**, but if option
 **-r** is specified, axes **ABS_RX**, **ABS_RY**, and **ABS_RZ** are
 used instead. See also section **VALUE UNITS** below.

## Low-level input simulation commands

**open**
:   Ensure that the input device is open and initialized.
 If this command was not specified, initialization happens
 before the first emulation command. Use this command if you have
 an **exec** before the first emulation command, and you want the
 device to be present when the external command is executed.

**input** {*axis***=***value* | **KEYDOWN=***key* | **KEYUP=***key*}...
:   Emulate a complex input message. This command allows
 you emulate a complex message that includes data for
 several axes and keys/buttons. This may be needed if you want to
 emulate, for example, some complex gamepad combo. See also sections
 **VALUE UNITS**, **AXIS NAMES** and **KEY NAMES** below.

# SCRIPTS

Commands for **udotool** can be given in a script file, using command
**script** or command-line option **-i** (**\-\-input**). Scripts
can be also made executable with a shebang syntax:

```
#!/usr/bin/udotool -i
exec echo "This script emulates 10 left mouse button clicks"
key -repeat 10 BTN_LEFT
```

**NOTE**: Since some systems don't properly split options in shebang
line, to combine several options you can use only short options:
**#!/usr/bin/udotool -vi** will work, but **#!/usr/bin/udotool -v -i**
won't.

In scripts, each command should be in a separate line. There is no
syntax for breaking a command into several lines.

Empty lines are ignored. Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.

Lines starting with hash (**#**) or semicolon (**;**), probably with
some whitespace before them, are treated as comments and ignored.

Command arguments may be enclosed in apostrophes (**\'...\'**) or
quotes (**\"...\"**). Inside quoted arguments, backslash character
escapes following character, so, for example, **\"A\\\"B\\\\\"** is
a 4-character string containing: character **A**, quote character,
character **B**, backslash character.

# VALUE UNITS

Values for various axes are specified in abstract "units":

- Relative axes are usually integer:
  - Movement in major relative axes (**REL_X**, **REL_Y**, **REL_Z**)
    is usually interpreted in pixels.
  - Wheel movement (**REL_WHEEL** and **REL_HWHEEL**) is in notches.
    It can be fractional, with maximum resolution of **1/120** of a notch.
- Position in absolute axes is specified percents (**0.0** to **100.0**)
  of a maximum range. For example, if your screen has size **1920x1080**
  pixels (FHD), then position **0.25 0.333333** is at pixel **(480,360)**.
  - For axes that have no natural range (for example, **ABS_PROFILE**),
    maximum range is **1000000** (one million), so to get axis value
    **42** you have to specify it as **0.000042**.

# AXIS NAMES

Full list of supported axis names can be retrieved using command
**help -axis**.

Following axis names are supported at the moment:

- Relative axes (mice, touchpads, gamepads, and similar):
  - **REL_X**, **REL_Y**, **REL_Z**: main axes used by most devices.
  - **REL_RX**, **REL_RY**, **REL_RZ**: additional axes (for example, rotation)
    used by some devices.
  - **REL_DIAL**: jog wheel on some devices.
  - **REL_MISC**: additional axis on some devices.
  - **REL_WHEEL**, **REL_HWHEEL**: mouse wheel and horizontal wheel axes.
- Absolute axes (touchscreens, tablets/digitizers, gamepads, joysticks, and similar):
  - **ABS_X**, **ABS_Y**, **ABS_Z**: main axes used by most devices.
  - **ABS_RX**, **ABS_RY**, **ABS_RZ**: additional axes (for example, rotation)
    used by some devices.
  - **ABS_THROTTLE**, **ABS_RUDDER**, **ABS_WHEEL**, **ABS_GAS**, **ABS_BRAKE**:
    additional axes used by some devices.
  - **ABS_HAT*n*X**, **ABS_HAT*n*Y** for *n* from 0 to 3: additional axes for
    secondary controls.
  - **ABS_PRESSURE**, **ABS_DISTANCE**, **ABS_TILT_X**, **ABS_TILT_Y**, **ABS_TOOL_WIDTH**:
    additional axes used by some digitizers.
  - **ABS_VOLUME**, **ABS_PROFILE**, **ABS_MISC**: special axes.

If you have the device that you want to emulate, you can use **evtest**(1)
to determine which axes it uses.

# KEY NAMES

Full list of supported key names can be retrieved using command
**help -key**. **WARNING**: The list is huge!

If the key you want to emulate is not in the list, you can specify
it as a number in decimal or (with prefix **0x**) hexadecimal.

If you have the device that you want to emulate, you can use **evtest**(1)
to determine which keys it uses.
